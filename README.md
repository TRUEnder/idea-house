dea House is a simple website that functions as a platform for sharing ideas. It provides features that are almost similar to blog hosting websites, such as uploading posts, an idea catalog (to view other people's ideas), liking other people's posts, and following and unfollowing other users.
It consists of one Node.js app that sends an HTML file as its response. The HTML page is crafted dynamically on the server using the EJS template engine. We used NoSQL database hosted in MongoDB Atlas to store application data.

This website was created as a group project for Software Project Management course.
